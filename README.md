# q3-Steinhardt
Fortran code to calculate the 3rd order Steinhardt parameter, q3. 

Calculate q3 for atom i by projecting vectors connecting atom i to its neighbours j onto the l=3 spherical harmonics.
Include real and imaginary component of spherical harmonics for completeness. 

q3 parameter quantifies order/disorder and allows us to assign molecules as liquid-like and ice-like.
